# Project description

One country, four languages. Multilingualism and coexistence of four national languages in Switzerland are one of the main characteristics of this country. Even though there are four national languages, in reality Switzerland speaks more languages than that. Over time, the other languages have made their road into the everyday life. Federal Statistical Office (OFS) has decided to run an inquiry and learn what are Swiss population linguistic practices. Here you can view the results of this inquiry.

The project uses data gathered by The Federal Statistical Office (FSO) during the inquiry on the linguistic image of Switzerland organized in 2014. 

The idea of this project is to convert data assembled by the FSO into a digital format and present it in the form of a website using data visualization and web-development technologies such as D3, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The website is a composition of various graphics representing the data. 


# The data

The data gathered during the inquiry is a spreadsheet composed of multiple small tables, divided by topics. In my visualization usually one visualization represents data of one or two tables. Some of the visualization have a small interactive element, where a user can choose which type of data she wants to visualize. 

__The aim is to render the data more accessible and give visibility to the research carried out by the The Federal Statistical Office.__
